# Лад / Tune

An interactive, bilingual (English + Ukrainian) storybook about **learning base concepts of music and guitar playing**, built with
[Astro](https://astro.build) + React islands and deployed statically to GitHub Pages.

> Article content lives in `content/en/*.md` and `content/uk/*.md` and is authored separately — the
> app turns each article into an interactive page. See `CLAUDE.md` for the full product spec, and
> `tasks/` for the live backlog.

## Develop

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # serves under the configured base, e.g. http://localhost:4321/tune/
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build      # static output in ./dist
npm run preview    # serve the built site locally
```

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)

1. Set `site` + `base` in `astro.config.mjs` to your repo (`https://<owner>.github.io` + `/<repo>`).
2. Push to `main`. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Source = "GitHub Actions"** (one-time).
3. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` builds and deploys on every push to `main`.
